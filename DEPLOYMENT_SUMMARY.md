## 🎯 What You Need to Do (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add SSH Key to VPS (2 minutes)

The deployment needs SSH access to your VPS. Add this public key:

```bash
# Connect to your VPS
ssh root@89.116.159.31

# Add the deployment key
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIPHDyT7svNRoUAIz0uM5eeFtSET1EjsQQKxzafE+ekPR github-actions-deploy" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Verify it was added
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys | grep github-actions-deploy

# Exit
exit
```

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secret (1 minute)

GitHub Actions needs the private key to connect to your VPS.

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/Troyboy911/petworkspace/settings/secrets/actions

2. **Click**: "New repository secret"

3. **Name**: `VPS_SSH_KEY`

4. **Value**: Copy this entire private key (including BEGIN and END lines):
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
QyNTUxOQAAACDxw8k+7LzUaFACM9LjOXnhbUhE9RI7EECsc2nxPnpD0QAAAJjdWfZK3Vn2
SgAAAAtzc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAACDxw8k+7LzUaFACM9LjOXnhbUhE9RI7EECsc2nxPnpD0Q
AAAECImsvHggawB5HuIMs+EF3Wklt0GdrsxnyLligzxgJ46vHDyT7svNRoUAIz0uM5eeFt
SET1EjsQQKxzafE+ekPRAAAAFWdpdGh1Yi1hY3Rpb25zLWRlcGxveQ==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

5. **Click**: "Add secret"

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment (30 seconds)

After completing steps 1 and 2:

**Option A: Automatic Trigger**
```bash
# Make any small change and push
cd pet-automation-suite
echo "# Deployment test" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Trigger**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Troyboy911/petworkspace/actions
2. Click "Deploy to Hostinger VPS"
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

## 📊 Monitor Your Deployment

### Watch Deployment Progress
https://github.com/Troyboy911/petworkspace/actions

The deployment process:
1. ✅ Connects to VPS via SSH
2. ✅ Creates backup of existing deployment
3. ✅ Clones/updates code from GitHub
4. ✅ Installs Docker & Docker Compose (if needed)
5. ✅ Stops old containers
6. ✅ Starts new containers
7. ✅ Runs health checks
8. ✅ Cleans up old images

**Expected Time**: 5-10 minutes for first deployment

---

## 🎉 After Successful Deployment

### 1. Access Your Dashboard
```
http://89.116.159.31:5000
```

### 2. Check Health Status
```
http://89.116.159.31:5000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "redis": "connected",
  "mongodb": "connected"
}
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

SSH into your VPS and configure environment variables:

```bash
# Connect to VPS
ssh root@89.116.159.31

# Navigate to deployment
cd /var/www/pet-automation/pet-automation-suite

# Edit environment file
nano .env
```

Add your API keys:
```bash
# Required for content generation
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Optional - add when ready
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_key
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_id
AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY=your_amazon_key
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_shopify_key
```

Save and restart:
```bash
# Save: Ctrl+X, Y, Enter
# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

---

## 🧪 Test Locally (Optional)

Want to test before deploying to production?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Troyboy911/petworkspace.git
cd petworkspace

# Run one-command test
./test.sh
```

This will:
- Start all services in Docker
- Open dashboard at http://localhost:5000
- Show you the logs

Stop testing:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
```

---

## 🔄 Future Deployments

After initial setup, deployment is automatic:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** GitHub Actions automatically deploys to your VPS.

   ssh -i /tmp/deploy_key root@89.116.159.31
   ```
3. Check GitHub secret is set correctly (Step 2)

### Issue: Deployment Succeeds But App Doesn't Start

**Solution:**
```bash
# SSH into VPS
ssh root@89.116.159.31

# Check logs
cd /var/www/pet-automation/pet-automation-suite
docker-compose logs -f app

# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Issue: Can't Access Dashboard
